# Terraform Examples - Signal Sciences Provider

You will find a variety of terraform configurations which you can use as is or for reference. 
There is a sample resource for just about every type in this repository.

I've taken the examples from this blog post: 
https://www.fastly.com/blog/10-pro-tips-for-getting-the-most-out-of-your-next-gen-waf
And converted them into terraform files. These files alone will give you a great starting point in terms of 
WAF protection.
